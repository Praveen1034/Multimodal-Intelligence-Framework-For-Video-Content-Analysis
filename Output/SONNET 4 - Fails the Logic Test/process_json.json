Floor 29 \u2014 30 (Button D: next multiple of 3 after 29 is 30) This 7-move solution is optimal! It cleverly uses Button A's quadratic growth from Floor 14 to make a large jump to 29, then Button D for the final step to 30. Why This Is Optimal: . 1. Avoids all traps: Never lands on Floor 13 or 22 2. Minimizes penalties: Only uses Button A when it won't trigger the penalty 3. Maximizes efficiency: Uses Button large jump capability at the right moment 4. Clean finish: Button D provides the perfect final step from 29 to 30 The key insight is that Floor 14 is the sweet spot where Button A can make a large jump without triggering penalties, setting up an easy finish to Floor 30.",
